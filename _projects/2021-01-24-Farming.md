This project consists of two first-person experimental experiences that I have created to explore a design that brings the player in, beyond the usual participatory  function, and assign them an active role the narrative. This is encompassed in two prototypes, one that uses the design idea and one that does not. Dreamers, borrows design techniques from walker games and explores fourth wall manipulation to create a positive-negative experience. Bringing the player in is a technique based on fourth wall breaking, which are often used to aid the arousal of positive and negative emotions in the players.
