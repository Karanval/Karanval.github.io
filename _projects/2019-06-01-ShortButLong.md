Short but Long is a cute game that explores how a *very* elastic corgi explores his house jumping around almost uncontrollably.
This was a project for the course Making Games, where we worked on a group of 6 people to make a game of at least 20 minutes gameplay. In this project I created the art assets including animations and environment programming.
