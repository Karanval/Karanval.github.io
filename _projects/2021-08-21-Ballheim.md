A small game jam game based on the Goldber machine concept where the player needs to create an arena which a ball needs to traverse through. A fun little concept that I would like to expand on some time.
In this project we were a group of 3 people, 3 programmers, where we meet online to come up with a concept and divide work. I worked on the ball's physics as well as the art and ui graphics.
