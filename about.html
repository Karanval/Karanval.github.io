   I'm Karolina, I like challenges and learning new things. I have studied system engineer back in Bolivia, and just finished a MsC degree on Games (tech track) in Copenhagen. I am someone that can work alone and on a team, I can be independent but also rely and communicate with others. I enjoy creating aesthetics in games, and I can go as technical as required when doing so. I also like playing with experiences and interactions in games, specially the ones that do unexpected things.
