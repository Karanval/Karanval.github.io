         I'm Karolina, I like challenges and learning new things. I have studied system engineer back in Bolivia, and just finished a MsC degree on Games (tech track) in Copenhagen. I am someone that can work alone and on a team, I can be independent but also rely and communicate with others. I enjoy creating aesthetics in games, and I can go as technical as required when doing so. I also like playing with experiences and interactions in games, specially the ones that do unexpected things.

         Sommehow my hobbies keep growing, what is constant is the want to create things, so I like to try different crafts. I'm currently obsessing with doll pattern making.
